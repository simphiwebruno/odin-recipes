    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>refrigerated dough</li>
        <li>6 ounces low moisture mozzarella cheese, thinly sliced</li>
        <li>half (1/2) teaspoon dried oregano</li>
        <li>quarter (1/4) teaspoon freshly ground black pepper</li>
        <li>half (1/2) cup no salt added canned crushed tomatoes</li>
        <li>two (2) tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil</li>
        <li>six (6) leaves fresh basil, torn</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Directions</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Remove dough from the refrigerator one hour prior to using.</li>
        <li>Preheat the oven, with a pizza stone on the lowest rack, to 550 degrees F (288 degrees C). Lightly dust a pizza peel with flour</li>
        <li>Prepare the first pizza
            <br>
            Lightly dust one dough ball with flour and stretch gradually until about 14 inches in diameter / about the size of the pizza stone. Place on the floured peel.
        </li>
        <li>Lay half of the mozarella on the crust, then sprinkle 1/4 teaspoon oregano and 1/8 teaspoon pepper ove the top. Randomly arrange 1/4 cup crushed tomatoes over the pizza, leaving some empty areas, then drizzle one tablespoon olive oil over top.</li>
        <li>With a quick back and forth jerk, make sure dough will release from the peel easily. Place the tip of the peel at the back of the preheated pizza stone, and remove the peel so that the pizza is left on the stone.</li>
        <li>Bake is the preheated oven until the crust begins to brown, 4 to 6 minutes.</li>
        <li>Slide the pizza onto the peel and remove from the oven; then slide off the peel onto a work surface. Sprinkle 1/2 of the basil leaves randomly over the pizza. Cut into wedges and serve</li>
        <li>Follow from the first step to make the second pizza.</li>
